### orders, order details, customers (companies), and products, among others, to support our analytical efforts."

###  3.View customer orders.
### * 4.Navigate sales by specifying the year.
### * 5.Measure the days between the order date and the shipping date. If there is no date in the shipping date, that means the shipping process is still pending.
### * 6.Demonstrate the top customer orders.

### * 8.Union all suppliers and employees with a custom column "Supplier/Customer".
